/**
 * NOTES
 * SQL query to list student id, name, and number of applications the student has
 * -- report 0 for student with no applications
 * List students by number of applications, then alphabetically by name
 *
 * PLAN
 * SQL is a query language so I'm not sure what that means about using it with JavaScript-
 * If it's just the query that would be used in a bigger project, I can look up the rules/syntax to figure it out
 *
 * QUESTIONS
 * ?? Should it even be saved in a JavaScript file?
